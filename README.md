# Sudoku
The repository contains a module for manipulating the familiar Sudoku puzzle. A module for manipulating puzzles of any size for purposes (creation, solution, etc.).

The repository provides modules that include functions and tools for comfortable solving and visualizing Sudoku, filled cells and a list of possible insertions.

Sudoku is a number puzzle. Sometimes Sudoku is called the magic square, which is generally not correct, since Sudoku is a 9th order Latin square. Sudoku is actively published by newspapers and magazines from around the world, collections of Sudoku are published in large editions. Sudoku solving is a popular leisure activity.

The playing field is a 9x9 square, divided into smaller squares with a side of 3 cells. Thus, the entire playing field consists of 81 cells. At the beginning of the game, they contain some numbers (from 1 to 9), called tips. The player is required to fill the empty cells with numbers from 1 to 9 so that in each row, in each column and in each small 3 Ã— 3 square, each number would appear only once.

The difficulty of Sudoku depends on the number of initially filled cells and on the methods that need to be used to solve it. The simplest ones are solved deductively: there is always at least one cell where only one number fits. Some puzzles can be solved in minutes, others can take hours.

A correctly formed puzzle has only one solution.

The best solution is to write down the candidate numbers at the top of the left corner of the cell, and then cross out the impossible numbers from this cell. After that, you can see exactly the numbers that can occupy this cell. Playing Sudoku slowly is recommended as it is a relaxing game.
